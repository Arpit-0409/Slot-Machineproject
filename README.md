# Slot-Machineproject


🎰 Emoji Slot Machine

A fun little console-based Slot Machine game built with Python. This project is a great way to practice Python fundamentals like functions, loops, conditionals, randomization, and user input handling — while also having a bit of fun with emojis.

 How It Works

You start with a balance (money in hand).

Place your bet amount (but make sure it’s not more than your balance).

The machine will spin three random emojis.

If all three emojis match, you win a payout depending on the emoji!

If they don’t match, you lose your bet.

You can keep playing until you decide to quit.

💰 Payout Rules

😂 → 3x your bet

😊 → 2x your bet

🤣 → 2.5x your bet

😒 → 6x your bet

😁 → 7x your bet

🕹 Example Gameplay
Enter amount : 100
Your Current Balance: 100
Enter bet amount: 20
Emojis: ['😂', '😊', '🤣', '😒', '😁']
**********
